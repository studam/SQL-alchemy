# SQL-alchemy

SQLite is a dialect for using an SQL database. The syntax is very similar to the PostgreSQL syntax, with the main difference between the two being that SQLite is entirely serverless. SQLite allows for the power of database storage but with a tiny footprint. SQLite is also conveniently part of the standard Python library, so no additional setup is needed to get it up and running.
SQLite is not comparable with PostgreSQL or any other SQL language, rather it focuses on providing local data storage for individual applications.

ORM 
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapper. Object-relational mapping allows us to write SQL queries using the object-oriented paradigm of the language with which you prefer to work. In other words, for current purposes  it allows us to interact with databases using Python.

Python is an "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language", which means that it is highly concerned with organization and reusability. Classes are crucial to OOP in that they allow us to group related things and keep them together.
A class is essentially a template that allows us to create objects, which have variables and behaviors associated with them. It helps streamline our code and create efficiencies whenever something needs to be used at various times.
You can find quick Class object reviews in 03-Python in the Reviews folder on Gitlab.


Objectives:

I connected to a SQL database using SQLAlchemy.
Performed basic SQL queries using the engine. execute().
Created Python classes and objects.
Created, read, updated, and deleted data from a SQL database using SQLAlchemy's ORM.
Reflected on existing databases.
Used the SQLAlchemy ORM to create classes that model tables.
Used the ORM to define relationships and foreign key constraints.
Used also joins to query related data.
Used Flask to create and run a server.
Defined endpoints using Flask's @app.route decorator.
Extracted query variable path values from GET requests.
Used variable paths to execute database queries on behalf of the client.
Return JSONified query results from API endpoints.
